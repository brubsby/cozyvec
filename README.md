# cozyvec

cozyvec is a terminal program for creating [plotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter) art (specifically via svg files) with minimal setup.

The library has been designed for brevity, so the code for a specific plot can be tweeted under the hashtag [#cozyvec]() (much like PICO-8's [#tweetcart](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tweetcart) and processing's [#つぶやきProcessing](https://twitter.com/hashtag/つぶやきProcessing)) by providing shortcut versions of most tokens that are 1-4 characters.
